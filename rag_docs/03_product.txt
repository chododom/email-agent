Aerial Dynamics Spectre-Pro Recon Drone (AD-SPR)

The Aerial Dynamics Spectre-Pro is the premier autonomous reconnaissance and cinematography platform. Built with a lightweight carbon-fiber frame and powered by silent electromagnetic propulsion, the AD-SPR is virtually invisible and capable of operating in the most challenging environments. Perfect for professional surveyors, search and rescue operations, and high-end aerial filmmakers, the Spectre-Pro offers unmatched stability, range, and image quality.

Key FeaturesSilent-Flight Propulsion: Utilizes proprietary Electro-Mag motors and adaptive $4$-blade folding propellers to achieve a noise signature of less than $35 \text{ dB}$ at $10 \text{ meters}$. Geo-Sense $360$ Avoidance: Equipped with $12$ multi-directional optical sensors and Lidar for intelligent $360$-degree obstacle avoidance and precise indoor navigation. ChronoCam Sensor: Features a $1$-inch $60 \text{ MP}$ CMOS sensor capable of capturing $8\text{K}$ video at $30 \text{ fps}$ and $4\text{K}$ at $120 \text{ fps}$, gimbal-stabilized across three axes. Long-Range Synapse Link: Provides a secure, low-latency video transmission range of up to $25 \text{ km}$ (FCC) using dual-band $5.8 \text{ GHz}/6 \text{ GHz}$ frequency hopping technology. Modular Payload System: Allows for quick swap of additional modules, including thermal cameras, advanced lighting systems, or specialized air quality sensors (sold separately).
